This is a pcm audio mixing demo for the iPhone, open up this xcode project
in the simulator and run it to hear the results of two mixed audio tracks.
Mixing two tracks before playing them is much better than using two
AVAudioPlayer objects because mixing actually keeps two audio tracks in sync.
The example sounds are a drum kit and a violin with lots of reverb.
